## ✍️ Glossary Prompt

To make a new glossary, this is a prompt to use:

> _"Create a glossary of terms for [topic or subject area] in Markdown format. Organize the terms alphabetically, include headers for each letter, and for each term provide a clear, beginner-friendly definition enriched with context, examples, use cases, or analogies where helpful. Keep tone friendly and engaging without sacrificing clarity or accuracy. Skip any letters that have no relevant entries. Do not include citation-style references or links. Focus on making the glossary practical and easy to understand."_
